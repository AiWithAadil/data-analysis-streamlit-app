## 🛠️ How It Works
### 1️⃣ Streamlit Framework
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python-based framework used to build interactive web applications with minimal code. It allows users to:
- Create UI elements easily (buttons, sliders, charts, etc.)
- Load and display datasets dynamically
- Perform real-time computations on user inputs

### 2️⃣ Using `uv`
The app can be executed with `uv`, a lightweight package manager and virtual environment tool, which ensures dependency management and environment isolation.

#### Steps to Run with `uv`:
```sh
uv venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
uv venv exec streamlit run app.py  # Run the app

```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Using `uv` (Recommended):
```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
OR using `pip`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the App
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
